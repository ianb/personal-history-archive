# personal-history-archive

Creating a dump of your personal browser history for analysis. This is a tool for people who want to research browsing behavior and content, starting with the only dataset you'll really be able to create: data about yourself.

## Motivation

This is for creating a *browsing corpus* for later analysis. It's not a feasible end-user tool, and it collects information that can't normally be shared. But if you are interested in browsing behavior and web content analysis, then this is the package for you!

The data collected here is specifically what you see and do via the browser. Unlike spidering or fetching documents via the command-line, you get fully rendered and personalized pages. This will help you include information in your corpus that specifically isn't available on the open web.

## Features

Using this tool you can:

* Extract your history from multiple browsers into a database
* Fetch high quality versions of your history items:
  * Get frozen pages from the browser (no worries about JavaScript)
  * Fetch pages using your cookies and authentication (get personal and personalized versions of pages)
  * All HTML is well-formed, links are made absolute
  * HTML can be re-rendered easily
* The frozen HTML has additional annotations to make it easier to interpret:
  * Hidden elements are marked as such
  * Elements whose `display` style is changed are marked as such (useful if you want to look for any block-like element)
  * The [Readability](https://github.com/mozilla/readability) library is used to extract a "readable" form
  * Elements in the original document that form the readable view are marked as such
  * The natural/rendered sizes of images are included
  * A first-page screenshot is taken, and a full-length thumbnail
* Track ongoing browsing; collecting additional information not in normal browsing history:
  * Reliably track what page leads to the next page
  * Track what link click lead to the next page
  * Track how often and for how long the page was the active tab
  * [And more!](./docs/activity-schema.md)
* A [Python library](./python/#readme) is included to help interpret your results:
  * Load and query history items and pages
  * Parse pages (using [lxml](http://lxml.de/))
  * A [growing list of miscellany](./python#helpers)...

## Examples

## Overview

This consists of two parts:

* A [browser extension](./extension#readme) (for Firefox and Chrome) to save your history and activity
* A [python library](./python#readme) to use and analyze the history

## Installation

You must check out this repository to use the package.

Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages, and to setup the Python **3** environment. (A virtualenv environment is created in `.venv/`)

After installation you must restart your Firefox browser (Chrome support is iffy right now), go to `about:debugging` and manually install the extension from `build/extension/`

Data will begin to be collected in `data/`


## Fetching history

![image](./docs/screencast-fetcher.gif)

Once you have history uploaded, you may want to fetch static versions of your old history (from before you installed the extension).

**Note:** these instructions are incorrect, and need updating after [#57](https://github.com/ianb/personal-history-archive/issues/57) is fixed.

Use `./bin/launch-fetcher` to launch a Firefox instance dedicated to that fetching. Probably use `./bin/launch-fetcher --use-profile "Profile Name"` to use a *copy* of an existing profile (after doing that once, the profile copy will be kept for later launches). You'll want to use a profile that is logged into your services, so that you can get personalized versions of your pages.

The page `http://localhost:11180/` will be loaded automatically in the fetcher browser instance, and that lets you start fetching pages.

You may want to review `http://localhost:11180/viewer/redirected` to see pages that get redirects. These are often pages that required missing authentication. You can login to the pages, then delete the fetched page so it can be re-fetched.

## Python library

There's a Python **3** library in [the `python/` subdirectory](https://github.com/ianb/personal-history-archive/tree/master/python). It gets automatically installed into the `.venv/` virtualenv, but you could install it elsewhere too.

You can install it like:

```sh
$ cd python
$ pip install -e .
# Optional packages:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This adds a package called `pha`. There is some information [in the subdirectory](python/), and the notebooks (`*.ipynb`) show many examples (though as of March 2018, they are out of date due to refactorings).

## Testing

The tests are in [`test/`](./test/). To run the tests:

```sh
$ npm test
```

You can use `NO_CLOSE=1` to leave the browser open after the test completes (this can be helpful to understand failures). Use `TEST_ARGS="..."` to add [Mocha command-line arguments](https://mochajs.org/#usage) such as `TEST_ARGS='-g 404s' npm test` to run tests with "404s" in the test description.

The temporary data will be in `test/test-data/` and you may find `test/test-data/addon.log` particularly interesting, as the Browser Console isn't very accessible from the test environment.

## Development

If you want to run it interactively in a fresh profile, use:

```sh
$ npm start
```

This will run a new browser profile, with data going into `dev-data/` (and logs in `dev-data/addon.log`). Changes are not automatically picked up, so you have to restart the browser after changes. There is no migration, so you may have to wipe out `dev-data/` after changes to the schema.

## Collaborating

If you have a question, probably the best thing is to [open a ticket](https://github.com/ianb/personal-history-archive/issues/new). If you are interested in implementing something, it would also be great to open a ticket so we can discuss.

If you'd like to chat, I've created a channel `#pha` on irc.mozilla.org. I (`ianbicking`) am usually only online during business hours, Central Time/UTC-6.
